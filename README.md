# Number-Game
My implementation of puzzle game PictoQuest.

# Rules
You are given a 5x5 grid, with mines randomly hidden throughout. 
Next to each row and column, there are a list of numbers that tells you how many consecutive empty positions are in that row.
For example, in the following image, the first row has 5 consecutive empty positions, 
and the second row has two sets of consecutive empty positions, each of width 1.

Your goal is to find all empty positions while hitting as few mines as possible.
You can check an empty position with the left mouse button, and mark a position as a possible mine with the right mouse button.
